//take user inputs and total them up as integers
// add up goal, exercise, food, and then print out the total

// make a popoup for the calendar - look up calendar popup tutorials that when a user clicks on the calender image,
// the popup appears displaying what they've eaten on the month they're currently at. try to make it progress
// like an actual calender would

// make an if-else statement that by the end of it subtracts food from the goal and then adds up the exercise and displays
// the amount of calories leftover under K CAL
// add option values in calorietracking.html
// option values that reference from a txt document that has all the food listed + total calories for each food listed.

// K CALORIES - small boxes - that will display the total amount of calories from the .txt document.
// all should add up and match with the "left" category under TOTAL
// create boxes for TOTAL, K CAL, and K CALORIES
// get an image of a basic calender with text underneath "VIEW CALENDER" (both the same image) that turns into a popup
// when user clicks on it, displays their calender with the current month and date highlighted(?) and food listed
//                                                                                                    (enter text?)
